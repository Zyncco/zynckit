# Playground
This directory is where you can test the modifications you've created. Any
modifications made locally to this directory won't be pushed to the git repo,
so feel free to hack away to your heart's content!

## Serving Files
For convenience, you can use `yarn run watch` to run a development server that
will reload every time you make changes to either the SCSS or the HTML.
